    "The pattern of our brain waves can change drastically depending on our mental state or task that is being executed. One example of that is during sleep phases, were our brain enters in different rhythmic patterns, related to its level of activity, depending on the sleep stage. These different patterns present distinct frequencies and, therefore, can be distingushed by spectral analysis, such as by looking at their periodogram or spectrogram and detecting the frequencies with the most power.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this approach fails to identify between Mu and Alpha waves, since their peak frequency lies on the same band, between 8 and 12 Hz. Howerver, they represent very distinct mental states.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Alpha waves* are generated on the thalamus and on the occipital lobe, and are in general found in different sleep stages, as well as might having some relationship with visual memory and perception of mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Mu waves* are encountered on motor cortex regions and generated by pyramidal neurons. During the performing and perception of motor actions, the decrease or suppression of mu waves can be detected, what is called desynchronization."
